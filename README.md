# Project Description.

The project is dedicated to developing a computer vision model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), capable of automatically classifying food images into 100 categories. The final product could be a convenient Telegram bot: the user uploads a photo of a dish, and the system returns its name along with additional information, including characteristics and recommendations.
